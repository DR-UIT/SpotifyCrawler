# Spotify Crawler

## Purpose
It's a simple app for academic purposes, that operates via Spotify API and allows exporting episodes names and year of publication to a csv file.

## Usage
The simplest and fastest way is to run main() method of an app (or launching a jar file).
It will show you the text interface.

Type `help` for all available commands.

Type `<command> --help` for info about command parameters.


The app requires you to have `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` set as environment variables for Spotify token retrieval.
More information can be found in [Spotify Web API reference](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).

## License
You can do with this code whatever you want, it's just a fast project to gather some info from Spotify for my wife for her academic research.
